    "As of 07/28/2020, the U.S. has 4.2 millions confirmed cases of COVID-19. New York City is the at the epicenter of the battle against the pandemics with more than 221,000 cases confirmed and approximately 56,000 cases of hospitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the hospital bed density and the COVID-19 case rate for each neighborhood in the New York City. The hospital bed density is measured as the number of beds per 1,000 people. It can be considered as one of the measurement of the service availbility. When pitted against the COVID-19 case rate, it can provide a better picture of the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is also motivated by [lisu1222: The battle of the neighborhoods: hospital density](https://github.com/lisu1222/The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods-New-York-Hospital-Bed-Density)"
